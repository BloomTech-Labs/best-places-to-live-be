#### Backend deployed at [https://stagebe.letsmovehomie.com/city](https://stagebe.letsmovehomie.com/city)

## üíª Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- Install MongoDB in your local machine: []https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
- Run MongoDB locally by entering `mongo` in your terminal.
- Inside the mongo instance enter:
```
use admin
```
and in the same mongo instance create a `letsmovehomie` user and `Fastwerds` password:
```js
db.createUser(
¬†¬†{
¬†¬†¬†¬†user:¬†"letsmovehomie",
¬†¬†¬†¬†pwd:¬†"Fastwerds",
¬†¬†¬†¬†roles:¬†[¬†{¬†role:¬†"userAdminAnyDatabase",¬†db:¬†"admin"¬†}¬†]
¬†¬†}
)
```
- Now that your local MongoDB is setup enter **npm start** in your terminal to start the local server.
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

# Seeding:

## Seeding all 392 Cities:
- To seed your local MongoDB with our 392 cities, install [mongo-seeding-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-seeding-cli)

- The file for seeding is inside `/data-seeding/1-cities/index.js`
for more information about the file structure: [Seeding MongoDB database the right way](https://medium.com/@pkosiec/seeding-mongodb-database-the-right-way-32a8a0e75490)

- Then execute `seed --db-name production ./data-seeding` in your terminal
this command will seed all 392 cities in your local MongoDB

## Seeding avg_commute_time_score
 - run `node /calculation-seeding/avg_commute_time_score.js` to calculate the letter grade (A, B, C, D, E) for each city in our database.

# MongoDB Database Backup:
 - To create a backup of the current MongoDB database:
 `mongodump -d production -o ~/mongoBackups/date-of-backup`

 - To restore a backup:
 `mongorestore ~/mongoBackups/date-of-backup/`

## üóÇ Backend Database:
-    MongoDB

## üìö Backend Libraries
